        <p>
          I am a software engineer based in Stockholm, passionate about creating
          impactful digital solutions. At PostNord, I work on systems that help
          millions of people across the Nordics track their parcels and packages.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a full-stack developer, I work across the entire technology stack –
          from crafting frontend experiences with Vue and React, to building
          scalable backend services with Node.js and serverless technologies. I
          particularly enjoy working with AWS CDK to create infrastructure as
          code, ensuring our cloud architectures are both robust and maintainable.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not writing code at work, you'll find me experimenting with
          modern frameworks like Next.js and Astro, playing around with Golang or
          fine-tuning my Neovim setup. Beyond the world of technology, I'm
          passionate about photography – both digital and analog. Feel free to
          check out some of my shots in the <span class="font-outfit">gallery</span> section! When not behind the
          camera or keyboard, I unwind with fantasy books and anime.
