      <h1>Hello.</h1>
      <p>My name is Mahadi Ahmed.</p>
      <p>
        I am a software engineer based in Stockholm, passionate about creating
        impactful digital solutions. At PostNord, I work on systems that help
        millions of people across the Nordics track their parcels and packages.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a full-stack developer, I work across the entire technology stack –
        from crafting frontend experiences with Vue and React, to building
        scalable backend services with Node.js and serverless technologies. I
        particularly enjoy working with AWS CDK to create infrastructure as
        code, ensuring our cloud architectures are both robust and maintainable.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not writing code at work, you'll find me experimenting with
        modern frameworks like Next.js and Astro, playing around with Golang or
        fine-tuning my Neovim setup. Beyond the world of technology, I'm
        passionate about photography – both digital and analog. Feel free to
        check out some of my shots in the gallery section! When not behind the
        camera or keyboard, I unwind with fantasy books and anime.
